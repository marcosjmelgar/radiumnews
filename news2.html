                China's leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged the country's scientists to accelerate the research and development of coronavirus vaccines.

                was developed by drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, with the remaining one jointly

            <p class="everyp">
                A vaccine usually takes years to develop. But to stop a virus that has killed more than a million 
                people worldwide, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines at unprecedented speed. In China, 
                efforts to ramp up that process have included the controversial testing of hundreds of thousands 
                of people outside the normal regulatory approval process.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                Since July, Chinese drug makers have been administering experimental vaccines on people working in 
                "high-risk" professions -- including medical workers and border agents -- under a government-approved 
                <a class="everyl" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/24/asia/china-vaccine-doctors-workers-intl/index.html">emergency use program</a>, 
                which allows vaccine candidates to be used on a limited scale before their safety and efficacy have 
                been fully proven by clinical trials.

            <img class="stages" src="./images/stages.JPG" alt="stagesccn">
            <p class="everyp">
                The vaccine candidates approved for emergency use are still in Phase 3 trials. Some experts worry that 
                fast-tracking the normal approval process could potentially expose participants to unknown side effects, 
                and Chinese drug makers are taking risks that contravene international ethical and safety norms.
