                <strong>Battle of Kohima-Imphal:</strong> Often overlooked, the Battle for 
                Kohima/Imphal is considered a decisive turning point for WWII. In this image, Corporal Edwards leads

                <strong>(CNN) —</strong> In a cataclysmic year during which the whole world has been beset by Covid-19, 
                gone almost unnoticed is the 75th nniversary of the end of the last great catastrophe to befall our planet -- WWII.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                But even within the context of that extraordinary war, there are amazing battles that have been forgotten.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                One such slice of history is the Battle for Kohima-Imphal, which was a decisive turning point in the war.
                It ended with the first major defeat suffered by Japanese forces in the Burma theater and thwarted their 
                ambitious plans to invade <a class="everyl" href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/destinations/india" target="_blank">India</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                In fact, in 2013 it was voted by the National War Museum as 
                <a class="everyl" href="https://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/kohima-britains-greatest-battle" target="_blank">Britain's greatest battle</a>
                ahead of the more celebrated engagements of D-Day and Waterloo.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                "The victory was of a profound significance because it demonstrated categorically to the 
                Japanese that they were not invincible,"
                said <a class="everyl" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-kohima-imphal-nagaland-manipur-w-idINDEE93K04W20130421" target="_blank">
                historian Robert Lyman at the museum</a>, following the announcement. "This was to be very important in preparing the entire 
                Japanese nation to accept defeat."

            <p class="everyp">
                The two northeastern states of Manipur and Nagaland and their capitals of Kohima and Imphal formed the 
                critical frontier for British India in their war against Japan on the Burmese front.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                A key route ran from the British supply base at Dimapur through Kohima up on a 
                ridge in the Naga Hills and down to Imphal in a small encircled plain in Manipur 
                and from there into Burma, the country known today as Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
            "Operation U-Go" was an audacious plan by the Japanese military command to capture this road by 
            using three divisions to attack simultaneously south and north of Imphal and to directly take Kohima. 
            Had it succeeded it would have given them the 
            critical springboard they needed to launch an all-out attack on British India.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                Today's visitors to Kohima will see no traces of that long-ago battle.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                The urban sprawl of the town has covered up the hills over which it was fought.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                But there is a World War II museum (entry Rs 50) located within the Naga Heritage Village 
                about 10 kilometers south of town.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                Displays include a diverse range of weaponry, tabletop models of battlefields, soldiers' uniforms 
                and historic photographs from both warring armies, though little attention has been paid to organization or detail.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                Even the interesting war documentary that plays in the background is spoiled through poor 
                acoustics and badly positioned display cases, which obstruct the screen.

                A visit to the Kohima War Cemetery, however, is not to be missed. Beautifully maintained by the 
                <a class="everyl" href="https://www.cwgc.org/" target="_blank">Common wealth War Graves Commission</a>, visitors will 
                find the plots of British and Indian servicemen who lost their lives in the defense of Kohima, numbering 2,340 in all.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                The British and Muslim soldiers are commemorated through simple elegant bronze plaques laid 
                out in neat rows and terraces, while the names of their Hindu and Sikh 
                compatriots who were cremated are inscribed on a separate memorial at the top of the cemetery.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                It is impossible not to be moved by the quiet beauty of the place and the heartrending 
                messages on the gravestones from the families of the fallen heroes.

            </h2>
            <p class="everyp">
                The Japanese attack caught the British by surprise as their High Command had not expected the enemy to 
                move so swiftly and in such large numbers through the thick jungle and mountainous terrain.

                Visiting the Imphal battlefields
            </h2>
            <p class="everyp">
                Unlike the hills of Kohima, it is possible to see the battlefields where the 
                titanic Imphal struggle played out, 140 kilometers south.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                To broaden its appeal, the museum focuses not just on the actual battle (depicted using a timeline, maps, 
                artifacts and photographs) but also on the post-war transition in Manipur and present-day arts and cultural life.
            </p>
            <p class="everyp">
                For the many Japanese visitors who lost their ancestors in this epic battle and for whom there are no graves and 
                cemeteries to visit, it offers a chance for closure, reminding us that in war there are no true victors, only losers.
