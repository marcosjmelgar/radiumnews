    <p><strong>(CNN) —</strong> In a cataclysmic year during which the whole world has been beset by Covid-19, gone almost unnoticed is the 75th 
        anniversary of the end of the last great catastrophe to befall our planet -- WWII.</p>
    <p>But even within the context of that extraordinary war, there are amazing battles that have been forgotten.</p>
    <p>One such slice of history is the Battle for Kohima-Imphal, which was a decisive turning point in the war. It ended with the first major defeat suffered by Japanese 
        forces in the Burma theater and thwarted their ambitious plans to invade <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/destinations/india" target="_blank">India</a>.</p>
    <p>In fact, in 2013 it was voted by the National War Museum as <a href="https://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/kohima-britains-greatest-battle" target="_blank">Britain's greatest battle</a> ahead of the more 
        celebrated engagements of D-Day and Waterloo.</p>
    <p>"The victory was of a profound significance because it demonstrated categorically to the Japanese that they were not invincible," said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-kohima-imphal-nagaland-manipur-w-idINDEE93K04W20130421" target="_blank">historian Robert Lyman at the museum, following the announcement.</a> 
        "This was to be very important in preparing the entire Japanese nation to accept defeat."</p>
