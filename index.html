        <strong>Battle of Kohima-Imphal:</strong> Often overlooked, the Battle for Kohima/Imphal is considered a decisive turning point for WWII. In this image, Corporal Edwards leads soldiers of 14th

        <strong>(CNN) —</strong> In a cataclysmic year during which the whole world has been beset by Covid-19, gone almost unnoticed is the 75th 
        anniversary of the end of the last great catastrophe to befall our planet -- WWII.
    </p>
    <p>
        But even within the context of that extraordinary war, there are amazing battles that have been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
        One such slice of history is the Battle for Kohima-Imphal, which was a decisive turning point in the war. It ended with the first major defeat suffered by Japanese 
        forces in the Burma theater and thwarted their ambitious plans to invade <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/destinations/india" target="_blank">India</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, in 2013 it was voted by the National War Museum as <a href="https://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/kohima-britains-greatest-battle" target="_blank">Britain's greatest battle</a> ahead of the more 
        celebrated engagements of D-Day and Waterloo.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The victory was of a profound significance because it demonstrated categorically to the Japanese that they were not invincible," said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-kohima-imphal-nagaland-manipur-w-idINDEE93K04W20130421" target="_blank">historian Robert Lyman at the museum</a>, following the announcement. 
        "This was to be very important in preparing the entire Japanese nation to accept defeat."

        The two northeastern states of Manipur and Nagaland and their capitals of Kohima and Imphal formed the 
        critical frontier for British India in their war against Japan on the Burmese front.
    </p>
    <p>
        A key route ran from the British supply base at Dimapur through Kohima up on a ridge in the Naga Hills and down to Imphal in a small encircled plain in Manipur 
        and from there into Burma, the country known today as Myanmar.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Operation U-Go" was an audacious plan by the Japanese military command to capture this road by using three divisions to attack simultaneously south and north of Imphal and to directly take Kohima. Had it succeeded it would have given them the 
        critical springboard they needed to launch an all-out attack on British India.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today's visitors to Kohima will see no traces of that long-ago battle.
    </p>
    <p>
        The urban sprawl of the town has covered up the hills over which it was fought.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there is a World War II museum (entry Rs 50) located within the Naga Heritage Village about 10 kilometers south of town.
    </p>
    <p>
        Displays include a diverse range of weaponry, tabletop models of battlefields, soldiers' uniforms and historic photographs from both warring armies, though little attention has been paid to organization or detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even the interesting war documentary that plays in the background is spoiled through poor acoustics and badly positioned display cases, which obstruct the screen.

        A visit to the Kohima War Cemetery, however, is not to be missed. Beautifully maintained by the <a href="https://www.cwgc.org/" target="_blank">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>, visitors will find the plots of British and 
        Indian servicemen who lost their lives in the defense of Kohima, numbering 2,340 in all.
    </p>
    <p>
        The British and Muslim soldiers are commemorated through simple elegant bronze plaques laid out in neat rows and terraces, while the names of their Hindu and Sikh 
        compatriots who were cremated are inscribed on a separate memorial at the top of the cemetery.

    <p>
        The Japanese attack caught the British by surprise as their High Command had not expected the enemy to move so swiftly and in such large numbers through the thick jungle and mountainous terrain.

        Unlike the hills of Kohima, it is possible to see the battlefields where the titanic Imphal struggle played out, 140 kilometers south.
